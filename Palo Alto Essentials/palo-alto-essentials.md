# Processing Architectures
- Single-Pass Parallel Processing (SP3)
    - Simultaneous traffic classification & enforcement
        + Full-stack single-pass inspection
- Heavily reduces latency & increases performance 
- Traffic Planes
    - Palo Alto splits hardware resources between two traffic planes
        + Control
            * Configuration, logging, reporting
        + Data
            * Signature matching, security & network processing
